# Cell_Density_App
An app that plots cell density data for the Fluorescence Single Microchannel Resonator (fSMR). 

Users have the flexibility to choose from a variety of parameters to group their data based on column names given in the initial input excel file. Users can also show multiple plots at once and have the option to represent their data as a density gradient or as a histogram. General plotting features are also included, among which are changing plot color, defining axes labels, adjusting label sizes, adjusting plot point size, and adjusting axes scales.
